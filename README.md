# City Activity Tracker

Project for CSCI 4300 Web Programming

## Entry Point:
You must access access the application through index.php located inside the root directory. If you attempt to access any of the pages without logging in through the login.php you will receive an error message indicating you must login.

## How to start the Project:
You need xampp with apache / mysql and you must import the sql code that is provided to create the appropriate databases. You can place all the files inside the htdocs folder in your xampp file and run the program through localhost to whichever folder you located the files to.

## Functionalities:
1. Register as a user to a specific location.
2. User can view activities within their area created by other users.
    - These activities will contain information, likes, and can be specified by their activity type
4. User can also search for specific activities by activity type, location, or even other usernames
5. User can create activities to share with other users in this platform
   - User can specify location, activity type, provide a title and description to their activity post.

1) This program will run on xampp or another apache / mysql middleware program. This requires you to place the appropriate files in the correct place
2) This program will require two additional directories "user_img" and "post_img" for the image functionality to work correctly. 
3) mysql script has been provided to help set up the databases needed for this program.
4) This program / application is ONLY for desktop use and has not been adjusted for mobile or tablet screens at this moment.
